> [info]
> **This Playground (and the functions playground) is a bit unstable on some computers. We are in the process of updating it so it is stable on _all_ computers!**

In this playground we are going to create some more generative art! We'll be using the concept of _recursion_ to create trees and different fractal-like objects!
